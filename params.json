I may pursue a full two-way IRC-to-HipChat bridge eventually but there are some complications to be addressed when trying to match HipChat users to IRC users.  TBD_\r\n\r\nIt uses [Godrb](http://godrb.com/) by default for daemonization and monitoring but you really could use any daemon spawning method you prefer.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n[AppNeta](http://www.appneta.com) hosts the #appneta channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) where we offer user support and answer questions.  Not as widely known, is that it's a great place to get direct chat time with the appneta team behind the scenes.  On a normal day, we have developers, sales, support and some executives all logged into IRC.\r\n\r\nInternally we use [HipChat](http://www.hipchat.com) and [Dan Riti](https://github.com/danriti) setup this bot so if someone types 'helpme' a notification gets sent to HipChat to ping the team that someone needs help in IRC.  It works great.\r\n\r\nMy problem was that when I forgot to boot [LimeChat for Mac](http://limechat.net/mac/), I would log in and have zero chat history.  I know I should instead have a dedicated $5 VM running [screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) and [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) somewhere but I just don't have the interest and I especially don't like screen.  So what's the logical next step?  Leverage some existing Ruby gems to create an IRC to HipChat Relay in [about 25 lines of code](https://github.com/pglombardo/IRC2HipChat/blob/master/irc2hipchat.rb).\r\n\r\n# How it Looks\r\n\r\n![irc2hipchat preview](https://s3.amazonaws.com/pglombardo/irc2hipchat_preview.png?x=1)\r\n\r\n# How to Use It\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    git clone https://github.com/pglombardo/IRC2HipChat.git\r\n    ```\r\n  \r\n2. Set your environment variables\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n      # Get your HipChat api token: http://www.hipchat.com/account/api\r\n      # or even better use a labeled Room Notification Token for better presentation\r\n      echo \"export HIPCHAT_API_TOKEN=xxx\" >> ~/.bash_profile\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  *Ubuntu Desktop note*: Modify your ~/.bashrc instead of ~/.bash_profile.\r\n\r\n  *Zsh note*: Modify your ~/.zshrc file instead of ~/.bash_profile.\r\n  \r\n3. Configure your HipChat room and IRC channel in `config.yml`\r\n\r\n    ```yaml\r\n    ---\r\n    HipChatRoom: AppNetaIRCLog\r\n    IRCChannel: '#appneta'\r\n    IRCServer: irc.freenode.org\r\n    IRCNick: irc2hipchat\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Restart your shell so the new environment variables take affect\r\n\r\n5. Bundle install\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    bundle install\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n6. Start the daemon\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    bundle exec rake start\r\n    ```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
